      I am a PhD student in the Earth and Planetary Sciences department at the
      University of New Mexico. I have a background in geology, environmental
      science (concentrated in ecology), and GIS.

      I do small-scale (big picture) mapping of planetary surfaces but mostly of
      Mars and Earth. GIS and software tools are somewhat lacking in this field,
      so I am working to bridge the gap between software engineers, scientists,
      and GIS folk.

      Non-professionally, I also enjoy taking photos. Once upon a time I drew
      and made art. Nowadays, that part of my brain has instead been put to work
      when I make maps or figures. I am by no means a designer and am always
      looking to improve!

      past experiences!
